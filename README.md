A python script that sets a new wallpaper adding following features to it:
* Wallpaper Image is selected randomly from the specified folder
* Random quote at the left bottom portion of wallpaper
* Required Stock tickers with current price and percentage change at the top right corner of wallpaper
Schedule the execution of the script(.py file) using Task Scheduler so the script runs in the background at the required interval. (ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Cr_YRQk7o)
